  <summary>My Coding Journey</summary>

<br>

"*Learning never stops*". A great mentor of mine, Sgt. Fransen III, once stressed this idea: that despite any achievements one might obtain in their lifetime, they should always view the world as though every day is an opportunity to learn something new. To place one's ego aside and embrace the possibilty that anyone, at anytime, can teach you something. This is a philosophy that I've diligently practiced throughout my life, not only as a young whippersnapper in the Marine Corps but even now as an older, wiser civilian. I had planned to stay and serve as long as they'd allow me until a training accident abruptly ended my military career. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little lost in the few years following my departure from the Corps, but with an amazing support system and a few jobs that taught me what I didn't want out of life, I found myself in a conversation with a friend who was a passionate developer. As soon as I realized how much fun I was having learning about the capabilities of coding, I was hooked. A popular coding YouTuber named Chris Sean advised me to check out a website called ZeroToMastery.com, and almost right away, I dove headfirst into the coursework. Since completing the Full Stack Web Developer course, I've committed myself to an advanced concepts JavaScript course. It has been an incredibly enjoyable experience, and like my old NCO, Sgt. Fransen, always said, *"Learning never stops"*.
